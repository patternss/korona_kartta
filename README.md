# korona_kartta (this app is deprcitated do the the end of the pandemic and the deprecation of the database by THL. The purpose of this repository is to function as a portfolio peace.)

- A web-app that presents the amount of new infection cases in Finland by major regions. 
- Uses a nodejs server and an express app.
- The map is drawn with Leaflet, an open-source js library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
- The data is retrieved through THL's API.
- the major regions of Finland are expressed in a geojson format and drawn with Leaflet
- the data from the THL is added on top of the regions
- Areas are colorcoded based on the rate of new infections 
- Designed to be mobile friendly
- App was fully functional when the database was still usable
- Motivation for the app was to produce a mobile friendly app to track the development of new corona infections in Finland, but it became a bit obsolete after some major news companies released similar maps
